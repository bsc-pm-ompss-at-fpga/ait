In order to add a new Xilinx board you have to create a directory tree in the ait/backend/xilinx/board/ folder with the following files:

ait/backend/xilinx/board/BOARD_NAME/
    - basic_info.json -> File containing some basic information
    - baseDesign.tcl -> Vivado template containing the already configured base elements of the board
    - [Optional] procs.tcl -> Tcl script that overwrites some board-specific procedures regarding clocks, frequency, address mappings, etc.

    [Optional] ait/backend/xilinx/board/BOARD_NAME/constraints/ -> Folder containing constraints files
    [Optional] ait/backend/xilinx/board/BOARD_NAME/sources/     -> Folder containing different HDL files that need to be added to the block design
    [Optional] ait/backend/xilinx/board/BOARD_NAME/ipdefs/      -> Folder containing a repository of the custom IPs present in the baseDesign.tcl template

The Accelerator Integration Tool will detect the folder and generate a bitstream targeted to the new board with the option "--board=BOARD_NAME".
